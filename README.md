# datalib
datalib provides access to two main collections. SEDLAC and LABLAC. Within each collection you will find
different "flavors" or modules that were created to ease you work and fit your needs. The SEDLAC collection
has undertook a huge structural change that implied a modification of datalib syntax. The LABLAC collection,
however, has not been updated to the new structure yet, but users will be notified when such change takes
place.
